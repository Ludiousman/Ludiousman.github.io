Here’s a simple HTML and CSS template that you can use to create your personal profile page:

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>My Profile</title>
          <style>
            /* Add your CSS styles here */
            body {
              font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            }
            .profile-picture {
              width: 150px;
              height: 150px;
              border-radius: 50%;
            }
            .introduction {
              margin-top: 20px;
            }
            .section {
              margin-top: 40px;
            }
            .section-title {
              font-weight: bold;
              font-size: 24px;
            }
          </style>
        </head>
        <body>
          <img class="profile-picture" src="your-profile-picture.jpg" alt="Your Name">
          <div class="introduction">
            <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name]. [Brief introduction about yourself.]</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Education</div>
            <ul>
              <li>[Your education details]</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Work Experience</div>
            <ul>
              <li>[Your work experience details]</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Skills</div>
            <ul>
              <li>[Your skills]</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Contact</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Email: [Your email address]</li>
              [Links to your social media profiles]
            </ul>
          </div>
        </body>
      </html>

      You can modify the HTML and CSS code to fit your needs. For example, you can change the font, colors, and layout of the page. You can also add more sections if you want to include more information about yourself.

      Make sure to replace the placeholder text (e.g., [Your Name], [Brief introduction about yourself.], etc.) with your own information.

      To make the page responsive, you can use CSS media queries to apply different styles depending on the screen size of the device. For example, you can change the layout of the page or adjust the size of the text and images for smaller screens.

      Sure! Here’s an example of how you can use JavaScript to add a button that toggles between a light and dark theme on your personal profile page:

      First, add a button to your HTML code:

      <button id="theme-toggle">Toggle Theme</button>
      Then, add some CSS styles for the light and dark themes. For example:

      /* Light theme */
      body.light-theme {
        background-color: white;
        color: black;
      }

      /* Dark theme */
      body.dark-theme {
        background-color: black;
        color: white;
      }
      Finally, add some JavaScript code to toggle between the light and dark themes when the button is clicked:

      const themeToggle = document.querySelector('#theme-toggle');
      const body = document.querySelector('body');

      themeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
        if (body.classList.contains('light-theme')) {
          body.classList.remove('light-theme');
          body.classList.add('dark-theme');
        } else {
          body.classList.remove('dark-theme');
          body.classList.add('light-theme');
        }
      });
      This code selects the theme-toggle button and the body element using the querySelector method. Then it adds an event listener to the button that listens for click events. When the button is clicked, the event listener checks if the body element has the light-theme class. If it does, it removes the light-theme class and adds the dark-theme class. Otherwise, it removes the dark-theme class and adds the light-theme class.

      You can modify this code to fit your needs. For example, you can change the styles for the light and dark themes or add more interactivity to the page.

      Sure! Incorporating a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma can help speed up development and make your personal profile page look more polished.

      To use Bootstrap, you can add the following link to the head section of your HTML code:

      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      Then, you can use Bootstrap’s classes to style your page. For example, you can use the container class to center the content on the page and add some padding:

      <div class="container">
        <!-- Your content here -->
      </div>
      You can also use Bootstrap’s grid system to create a responsive layout for your page. For example, you can use the row and col classes to create a two-column layout for larger screens and a one-column layout for smaller screens:

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <!-- Column 1 content here -->
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <!-- Column 2 content here -->
        </div>
      </div>
      Bootstrap also provides many other components and utilities that you can use to style your page, such as buttons, forms, and typography.

      To use Bulma, you can follow a similar process. First, add the following link to the head section of your HTML code:

      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.3/css/bulma.min.css">
      Then, you can use Bulma’s classes to style your page. For example, you can use the container class to center the content on the page:

      <div class="container">
        <!-- Your content here -->
      </div>
      You can also use Bulma’s grid system to create a responsive layout for your page. For example, you can use the columns and column classes to create a two-column layout for larger screens and a one-column layout for smaller screens:

      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column is-half">
          <!-- Column 1 content here -->
        </div>
        <div class="column is-half">
          <!-- Column 2 content here -->
        </div>
      </div>
      Bulma also provides many other components and utilities that you can use to style your page.
